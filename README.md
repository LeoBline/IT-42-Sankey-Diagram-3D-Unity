# IT-42-Sankey-Diagram-3D-Unity
This is the UNISA IT Project; This is a Unity project.  The purpose is to convert the imported data into a 3D Sankey diagram in Unity.  And add a series of functions to better display the visual data graph.
This is the last semester project's Upgraded version.
The last semester project will show the 2D Sankey Diagram in Unity:

 So This Upgraded version will change it to 3D     !!X)!!
 
**Facing Problem**
1.The LineReaderer component used for energy transfer in the project last semester.  But this component cannot customize its three-dimensional width.  Only the width of the line can be set.  This is not applicable to energy transfer in real 3D.
2.Decide whether to adaptively adjust the size of the bottom area of the nodes.
